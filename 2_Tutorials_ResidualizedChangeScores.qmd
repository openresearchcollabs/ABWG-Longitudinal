## Overview
Residualized change scores are a statistical approach that allows for examining the true change in a variable over time by controlling for the initial level of that variable. This method is commonly employed in longitudinal research, especially in fields such as psychology, education, and medicine. Residualized change scores offer a way to address a significant concern in repeated measures: the potential correlation between initial scores and their subsequent change. By using regression analyses, the score at Time 2 is predicted based on the score at Time 1. The residuals from this analysis, which represent the portion of the Time 2 score not predicted by the Time 1 score, give the residualized change score. This score effectively captures the 'true change' from Time 1 to Time 2. In essence, this method seeks to answer the question: Given where someone started (Time 1), did they end up higher or lower than expected at Time 2? By removing the influence of initial levels, researchers can gain clearer insights into the factors that drive genuine change over time.

### When to use Difference Score Models?
You should use difference scores in the following scenario:

1. You want to know: The impact of interventions or time on a measured variable.
2. Your variable: Has paired measurements, like pre-test and post-test scores.
3. You have: Matched data for each set, ensuring valid difference computations.

### Getting Started with Difference Score Models
In this tutorial, we will guide you through two simple examples of using difference scores. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

1. Understand the basic concepts of difference scores.
2. Calculate difference scores using example data.
3. Interpret the results of the difference scores analysis.

## Basic Example
In this tutorial, we will begin by generating a sample dataset directly within R to ensure everyone has the same starting point and can follow along without needing to download or access external files. This generated dataset will serve as our example throughout this tutorial. In your own analyses, you'll likely start by importing your own data.

The simulated dataset created for this example consists of scores on a single outcome variable ("Job_Satisfaction") for 500 individuals each measured at two time points: T1-T2. 

#### Create Example Dataset
```{r}
# This will create a dataset with 1000 rows (2 rows for each of the 500 individuals).

# Creating the example dataset
set.seed(123) # for reproducibility

# Setting the number of individuals for our sample data
n <- 500

# Specifying the desired correlation matrix for our data
cor_matrix <- matrix(c(1, 0.30, 
                      0.30, 1), 
                      nrow=2)

# Using Cholesky decomposition to generate correlated data
cholesky <- chol(cor_matrix)

# Generating correlated random data
random_data <- matrix(rnorm(n * 2), ncol=2)
correlated_data <- random_data %*% cholesky

# Converting the generated data into a structured data frame
data_large <- data.frame(
  Individual = rep(1:n, each=2),
  TimePoint = rep(c("T1", "T2"), times=n),
  Job_Satisfaction = c(correlated_data[,1], correlated_data[,2])
)

```

### View Dataset
```{r}
head(data_large)
```

### Model Specification and Estimation
To specify a Residualized Change Score, we will conduct a basic regression analysis using base R. Residualized change scores allow us to estimate the change in an outcome variable after accounting for its initial value, effectively removing the effect of the baseline measurement.

#### Model 
```{r}
# Extracting Job_Satisfaction scores for the two time points
t1_scores_large <- data_large$Job_Satisfaction[data_large$TimePoint == "T1"]
t2_scores_large <- data_large$Job_Satisfaction[data_large$TimePoint == "T2"]

```

#### Fit Model
```{r}
# Perform the paired t-test
test_result <- t.test(t1_scores_large, t2_scores_large, paired = TRUE)
```

### Model Summary
```{r}
print(test_result)
```

### Interpreting the Results
The paired t-test was conducted to compare Life Satisfaction scores at two time points: T1 and T2. The test yielded a t-value of t=`r round(test_result$statistic, 3)` with `r test_result$parameter` degrees of freedom. The associated p-value is p=`r round(test_result$p.value, 3)`. This p-value is greater than the common significance level of 0.05, which means that we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The 95% confidence interval for the mean difference ranges from `r round(test_result$conf.int[1], 3)` to `r round(test_result$conf.int[2], 3)`. The observed mean difference between the two time points is `r round(test_result$estimate, 3)`.

## Conclusion
There is no statistically significant difference in Life Satisfaction scores between the two time points, T1 and T2, based on the paired t-test results. The mean difference, although positive (`r round(test_result$estimate, 3)`), is not significant at the 0.05 level.
