This method offers a way to address a significant concern in repeated measures: the potential correlation between initial scores and their subsequent change. By using regression analyses, the score at Time 2 is predicted based on the score at Time 1. The residuals from this analysis, which represent the portion of the Time 2 score not predicted by the Time 1 score, give the residualized change score. This score effectively captures the 'true change' from Time 1 to Time 2. In essence, this method seeks to answer the question: Given where someone started (Time 1), did they end up higher or lower than expected at Time 2? By removing the influence of initial levels, researchers can gain clearer insights into the factors that drive change over time.\n\n![Figure x. Residualized change score add explanation or tag](./figures/Residualized Change Score.png)\n\n### When to use a Residualized Change Score Model?\nYou should use residualized change scores in the following scenarios:\n\n1. You want to know: How much change in a variable, beyond its initial level, is due to another variable.\n2. Your variable: Has baseline measurements and subsequent measurements to calculate change.\n3. You have: Data that allows for controlling the initial status, thus focusing on the unique change.\n\n### Getting Started with Residualized Change Scores\nIn this tutorial, we will guide you through two simple examples of using residualized change scores. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n\n1. Understand the basic concepts of residualized change scores.\n2. Calculate residualized change scores using example data.\n3. Interpret the results of the residualized change scores analysis.\n\n## Basic Example\nIn this tutorial, we will begin by generating a sample dataset directly within R to ensure everyone has the same starting point and can follow along without needing to download or access external files. This generated dataset will serve as our example throughout this tutorial. In your own analyses, you'll likely start by importing your own data.\n\nThe simulated dataset created for this example consists of scores for 500 individuals on an outcome variable (\"Job_Satisfaction\") measured at two time points (T1-T2) and a predictor (\"Life_Satisfaction\") measured at one time point (T1). \n\n#### Create Example Dataset\n```{r}\n# Setting the seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Setting the number of individuals for our sample data\nn <- 500\n\n# Specifying the desired correlation matrix for our data\ncor_matrix <- matrix(c(1, 0.3, \n                      0.3, 1), \n                      nrow=2)\n\n# Using Cholesky decomposition to generate correlated data\ncholesky <- chol(cor_matrix)\n\n# Generating correlated random data\nrandom_data <- matrix(rnorm(n * 2), ncol=2)\ncorrelated_data <- random_data %*% cholesky\n\n# Converting the generated data into a structured data frame in wide format\ndata <- data.frame(\n  Individual = 1:n,\n  Job_Satisfaction_T1 = round(runif(n, 5, 10)),\n  Job_Satisfaction_T2 = round(runif(n, 5, 10)),\n  Life_Satisfaction_T1 = round(correlated_data[,1] * 2 + 7)\n)\n\n```\n\n### View Dataset\n```{r}\nhead(data)\n```\n\n### Model Specification and Estimation\nTo specify a Residualized Change Score, we will conduct a basic regression analysis using base R. Residualized change scores allow us to estimate the change in an outcome variable after accounting for its initial value, effectively removing the effect of the baseline measurement.\n\n#### Fit Model \n```{r}\n# Estimate the residualized change score model\nmodel <- lm(Job_Satisfaction_T2 ~ Life_Satisfaction_T1 + Job_Satisfaction_T1, data = data)\n\n```\n\n### Model Summary\n```{r}\nsummary(model)\nprint(model)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\n## Creating variable (names) from output to be used for inline text\n\nlibrary(broom)\ntidyfit <- tidy(model)\ntidyaugment <- augment(model)\ntidyglance <- glance(model)\n\n\nLife_Satisfaction_T1_estimate <- round(tidyfit[tidyfit$term == \"Life_Satisfaction_T1\", \"estimate\"], 3)\n\nLife_Satisfaction_T1_pvalue <- round(tidyfit[tidyfit$term == \"Life_Satisfaction_T1\", \"p.value\"], 3)\n\n# Extract values from the tibble for inline text\nLife_Satisfaction_T1_estimate <- Life_Satisfaction_T1_estimate$estimate\nLife_Satisfaction_T1_pvalue <- Life_Satisfaction_T1_pvalue$p.value\n\n```\n\n### Interpreting the Results\nThe residualized change score model was conducted to examine the effect of `Life_Satisfaction_T1` on `Job_Satisfaction_T2` while controlling for `Job_Satisfaction_T1`. The coefficient for `Life_Satisfaction_T1` is `r Life_Satisfaction_T1_estimate`, which represents the adjusted change in `Job_Satisfaction_T2` for each one-unit increase in `Life_Satisfaction_T1`, keeping `Job_Satisfaction_T1` constant. The associated p-value for this effect is p=`r Life_Satisfaction_T1_pvalue`. If this p-value is less than the common significance level of 0.05, it suggests that the effect of `Life_Satisfaction_T1` on `Job_Satisfaction_T2` is statistically significant after accounting for initial levels of `Job_Satisfaction_T1`.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe residualized change score model provides insights into the relationship between `Life_Satisfaction_T1` and the change in `Job_Satisfaction` from T1 to T2, controlling for initial levels of job satisfaction. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we can conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between initial life satisfaction and the subsequent change in job satisfaction. Otherwise, we do not have enough evidence to assert such a relationship.\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Overview\nResidualized change scores are a statistical approach that allows for examining the true change in a variable over time by controlling for the initial level of that variable.
